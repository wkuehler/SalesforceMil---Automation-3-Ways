# Automation 3 Ways

This repo contains the results of our Oct 23rd, 2020 military trailblazer office hours call where we walked through "Automation 3 Ways".

Our use case was a hypothetical client who wanted to automatically create a project record whenever an opportunity stage was updated to closed won.

We completed this using process builder, flow as well as an apex trigger.
